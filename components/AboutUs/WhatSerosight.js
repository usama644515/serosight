        <p>
          SeroSight is a biopharmaceutical enterprise that delivers actionable
          insights to consumers through its proprietary immune profiling
          platform technologies. These innovations facilitate the monitoring of
          disease risk, exposure, and overall health status. SeroSightâ€™s
          platforms leverage highly multiplexed immunologic assays to enable
          sensitive, high-resolution analysis of antibodies and other
          immunologic biomarkers from minimal samples, such as less than 1ml of
          serum or a Dried Blood Spot (DBS).
